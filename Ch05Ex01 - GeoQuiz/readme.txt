Challenge: Closing Loopholes for Cheaters

Cheaters never win. Unless, of course, they persistently circumvent your anticheating measures. Which
they probably will. Because they are cheaters.
GeoQuiz has a few major loopholes. For this challenge, you will busy yourself with closing them. Here
are the loopholes in order, from easiest to hardest to close:

• Users can rotate CheatActivity after they cheat to clear out the cheating result.

• Once they get back from CheatActivity , users can rotate QuizActivity to clear out mIsCheater .

• Users can press NEXT until the question they cheated on comes back around.

Good luck!
